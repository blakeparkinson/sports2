            <div>Rosterblitz represents our desire to play sports trivia in a new way. Instead of random, disparate questions, we put together quizzes organized by how you think about sports--by team. </div><br />
            <div>Along with the roster quizzes, we included the option to test your knowledge of the best of the best actively playing (in our season leaders quizzes) and the greatest ever (GOATS).</div><br />

            <div>Try it out! It's free. It's fun. Fair warning: it's a little addictive.</div>
